 @brief Affine Arithmetic Desion Diagrams, manager of conditions and control-flow statements.
 @details The file defines the static class instance that manages conditional stmts and loops.
 @details We destinguish paht conditions and block conditions. 
 @details  Path conditions are all conditions between the program start and the current point of execution
 that cannot be evaluated to true or false at runtime.
 @details Block conditions are the conditions that are a condition to the current assignment statements.
 Block conditions stem from conditional or iteration statements.
 @details Furthermore, we implement here other static stuff such error messages etc.
