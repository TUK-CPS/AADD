 @brief Affine Arithmetic Desion Diagrams manager of block and path conditions.
 @details The file defines the static class instance that manages conditional stmts and loops.
 @details We destinguish path conditions and block conditions.
 @details  Path conditions are all conditions between the program start and the current point of execution
 that cannot be evaluated to true or false at runtime.
 @details Block conditions are the conditions that are a condition to the current assignment statements.
 Block conditions stem from conditional or iteration statements.
 @details Furthermore, we implement here other static stuff such error messages etc.
