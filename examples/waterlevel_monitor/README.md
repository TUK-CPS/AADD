This example is a model of a famous water level monitor. 
It is written in SystemC AMS using the discrete-time TDF model of computation. 
It writes a file that has the upper and lower bounds of the water level in it. 
The file can be plotted with gnuplot. 
There are two scripts for translating it to PDF or to SVG file format.
