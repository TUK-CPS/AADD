This directory contains examples for symbolic simulation with SystemC. 

SystemC can be downloaded from www.accellera.org. 
It is a simulator for hardware/software systems that is implemented as an extension library for C++. 
It can easily be combined with libAADD. 

Contents are (not all on public git, only accepted publications): 

* waterlevel-monitor, the famous water level monitor. 
* sigma_delta_modulator, a 3rd order delta-sigma-modulator in SystemC AMS. 
* counter, a 4-bit counter as a simple example of the discrete-event simulation.  
* Dual-chargepump-PLL, a dual charge pump PLL originally designed in Cadence and exported to SystemC.
